Project Overview: BMI Calculator App
The BMI Calculator App is a user-friendly tool designed to help individuals assess their body
mass index, a key indicator of health status. By inputting their weight and height, users caN
easily determine if they fall within a healthy weight range, which can guide lifestyle and
dietary choices.

This app will feature a simple and intuitive interface, making it accessible for users of all
ages. Upon launching the app, users are prompted to enter their weight in kilograms and height
in meters. Once the data is submitted, the app calculates the BMI using the formula: 
BMI = weight / (height^2). The resulting value is then displayed along with a classification
(e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese) based on standard BMI categories.

Additionally, the app can provide health tips based on the BMI result, encouraging users to
maintain a healthy lifestyle. Future enhancements may include tracking BMI over time and
integrating features for users to set and monitor health goals. Overall, the BMI Calculator
App serves as a practical tool for promoting awareness of body weight and health management.
